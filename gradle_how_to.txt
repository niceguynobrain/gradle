Basic Gradle files:

	Shell script (?)

Hello World:
	"./gradlew " is the gradle wrapper 
	A wrapper contains just enough info to run a task.
	Use the wrapper to run a task: " <wrapper> <task> "
	i.e. " ./gradlew hello"

	With gradle installed I can use "gradle <task_name>",
	there is no need for the wrapper.

Gradle Daemon:
	'A daemon is process which hangs around in the back ground 
	of an opperating system doing something useful,
	when gradle is instructed to use a daemon, a daemon process
	is started and runs in the back-ground.'
	In short: A daemon makes gradle run faster. 

" gradle -b <file_name.gradle> <task_name>" specifies the build file
	for that task. 

Commands:

To run a build, run gradle <task> ...

To see a list of available tasks, run gradle tasks

To see a list of command-line options, run gradle --help

To see more detail about a task, run gradle help --task <task>
