Basic Gradle files:

	Shell script (?)

	"./gradlew " is the gradle wrapper 
	Tasks command using the gradle wrapper "./gradlew tasks"
		this gives a list of all the tasks gradle knows about
	Use the wrapper to run a task: " <wrapper> <task> "
	i.e. " ./gradlew hello"

Gradle Daemon:
	'A daemon is process which hangs around in the back ground 
	of an opperating system doing something useful,
	when gradle is instructed to use a daemon, a daemon process
	is started and runs in the back-ground.'
